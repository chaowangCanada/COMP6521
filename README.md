# COMP 6521

There are two test files for writing the code:
- [t1.txt](NonRepeatedRadomNumGenerator/t1.txt) contains 5,000 items;
- [t2.txt](NonRepeatedRadomNumGenerator/t2.txt) contains 10,000 items;
  All 7-digit numbers in each file are distinct, but they may duplicate in two files.
  Of course, you can generate more items if you want, please look at the `index.js` file under directory `NonRepeatedRadomNumGenerator`. If you want to generate more test files, `node.js` environment is required.
